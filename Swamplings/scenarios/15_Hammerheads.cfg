            story= _ "Who the devil was Yushnak the Ponderer?

Yushnak ruled the Snakebite Clan for almost a generation. They were a tiny clan when he first came to power, but Yushnak the Ponderer built them up into the most powerful in the territory, then brought them to total ruin. A brilliant tactician -- some say he was the wisest orc in millennia. He consolidated and co-opted many clans into his own, building up his power. His troubles began with his first bride, a goblin girl who died giving birth."

            story= _ "Deaths like these are expected by the orcs, which is why a chieftain may have as many brides as he wants. But Yushnak was troubled, and sought counsel from his shamen. He began to ask, why are some orcs born so small? Why do so many die in their first year? The shamen could not answer him. Or perhaps they knew but would not tell.
            	
He married another goblin and she also died giving birth. That's when he began his quest to different shamen in far-flung regions – he risked his life many times, but he had to find the truth."

            story= _ "No shamen would answer him directly but he began to piece together a theory. Perhaps the orc bloodline was less than pure – perhaps it had been polluted by another ancient race? The mere mention of this idea caused many shamen to shrink in horror.
            	
Yusnak's years of travel had brought him no closer to his answer. He was sick of lies and out of patience. He called together the shamen from all nearby clans, promising a banquet in their honor. Many stayed away, suspecting some treachery, but many were not as prudent. When they arrived they were imprisoned and tortured."

That was the night we call the Splintering. The Snakebite clan turned on their own goblin kin, killing many, driving out the rest. We were herded together on tiny boats and ferried deep into the bogs, where they left us to fend for ourselves. On one of those boats was Misgraol, Yusnak's third bride, pregnant with his child."

Not an orc in the clan was allowed to live, not a single trace was left of them. Salt was poured on the land where Snakebite Clan had walked, so no life would ever grow there.

And the goblins? Some joined other clans, and some were enslaved by saurians. Many died in the wilderness. Others, like Misgraol and her son Clammie, survived."

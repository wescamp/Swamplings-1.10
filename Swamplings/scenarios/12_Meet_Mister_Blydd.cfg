It may come as a surprise to you, but I did not truly intend to let Skandix take my life in the cave of the dire wolf. I needed him to show me where this cave was hidden, though."

I was walking with my father along the bank of the river, and on the other side we saw a magnificent beast, tottering along on stiff legs. We hid in the bushes, but to my amazement, the wolf swayed suddenly and fell over on its side. My father crept forward and using his spear, cut the wolf’s throat. It was already dying, he told me. He did it out of respect.


My father used to call dire wolves the step-aheads because, he said, they were one step ahead of the orcish. Many times I asked him to explain this, but he refused to answer."

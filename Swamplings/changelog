Version 1.1.6n - 5/12/11
- New art: added GangrN's Eeep and wolf portraits.
- S1: Fixed some unit facings during dialogs.
- S5: There are now 20 turns to find the Archduke. The first round of the Archduke's army will not have the quick trait. Initial dialog at trapdoor will be triggered if Kennison goes to the spot. In hard games, guards inside the secret passage are now set to ai guardian. Fixed a bug which sometimes put these guards into easy or regular difficulty games. Fixed bug that occurred if Clammie reaches the rope before Kennsion.
- S12: Increased Sgt Mugwyn's hitpoints to 50.
- S14: Some additional dialog regarding Ronry's robe. Some changes to the Limit Contemporaneous Recruit parameters for Kleezyk's army. Minor changes to some water tiles.
- S16: Recruited swamp wolves now receive orcish names.
- S1,S3,S6,S11,S13,S15,S16: wolf battle macros.
- Gave Nocturne an additional 5-3 hatchet attack.
- Fixed Sergeant small portrait, since it no longer exists in core.
- Renamed giant rat to avoid conflict with mainline giant rat.
- Updated Pillager, Cutthroat & Firefly defense/attack animations.
- Added [filter_side] tags all over the place.
- Removed deprecated macros AMLA_TOUGH, ITM_GLOWING_BRAZIER, and RECALL_OR_CREATE_UNIT.
- Since the [unpetrify] tags in 1.9.3 no longer accept the filter tag as they did in 1.9.2, I removed all [unpetrify] tags and am using the old workaround method. It was either that, or tell players to update their copy of Wesnoth after they noticed a problem, which is not my idea of tech support.
- Shortened some unnecessarily long binary paths in scenario and unit files.
- ran wmllint & wmlscope.

Version 1.1.5n - 12/3/10
- S2: Changed the method of counting bats to ensure against an intermittent bug. Bats get full heal, attacks and movements restored before flying into the bat box.
- S14: A black exclamation point appears when one of your units gets petrified.
- S16: Finally changed the line "He's got all Wesnoth allied against us!" to "He's got all the continent allied against us!"
- S3,S4,S16: Changed goblin keep to match the one in Shining. 
- Updated Easy/Medium/Hard icons to use Stern's custom sprites.
- After further investigation, it looks like the [and] tag is fine.

Version 1.1.4n - 11/30/10
- S2,12,14,16: Fixed major bug caused by changes to the [and] tag in version 1.9. This bug made it impossible to complete the Healer & Slayer scenario.
- S2: shed location is picked at beginning of scenario to avoid console error messages.
- S2: charmed bats with less than 1 hitpoint now die.
- added Trumpeter and Prime northeast facing sprites.
- removed strict_amla key from Prime unit type, to avoid console error messages.

Version 1.1.3n - 11/24/10
- New art: Misris portrait by GangrN, Goblin Prime sprites by Stern, saurian child sprite by artisticdude.
- S2,5,14: replaced all removeitem tags with remove_item.

- Removed portraits that are available in Wesnoth 1.9.2 core (Orc Sovereign, Orc Leader, Crossbowman, Grunt 6, Swordsman, Draug, Draug 2, Ghoul, Skeleton Archer, Bone Shooter, Banebow, Goblin Spearman 2).

Version 1.1.2n - 10/13/10
- New trumpeter sprites by Stern.
- S11: New unmanned caravan in Thunderstruck. Removed misleading info in the carryover report.
- S12: Greta no longer appears in recall list and on the map at the same time.
- S1: Updated Clammie's keep.
- Ran wmlindent.

Version 1.1n - 9/28/10
- First version for Wesnoth 1.9 development branch. Updated terrain macros for compatibility. Using new mainline MOVE_UNIT macro instead of custom macro. Updated wolf sounds in custom units. All on/off booleans changed to true/false. Updated deprecated keys: 'colour' 'format'. Ran the whole enchilada thru wmllint.
- S1: Changed Shining's AI to passive leader. Increased the size of Clammie's keep.
- S5: Slight changes to map. Animated torches! The third secret passage is slightly different, to accomodate a bug in rendering villages in front of the new wall terrain. In hard games, enemy units are inside the first secret passageway. Units are pushed if they occupy a hex that turns into a wall. Units die if they trigger enough traps to go below zero hp. Rat King can recruit a limited number of Bosavi, based on difficulty level.
- S6: Changed Cat's AI to passive leader. Placed hills around Cat's keep. Cat's bodyguards now appear on the first turn to avoid tomato surprise. 
- S11: Misris can now recruit Wolf Riders. Zslap has a leading animation. Fixed Zslap description to include her skirmish ability.
- S13: Hertrazzir now has a leading animation. Fixed objectives screen so it won't display at the saurian's first turn. Fixed Hertrazzir description to include her skirmish ability.
- S14: Finally fixed the Seven Bones: in Hard games, the entrance is always open; in Normal, the entrance opens right after you meet Xaztex; in Easy, the entrance opens after the meeting with the Swift One. In Easy games, non-flying units may also enter. Tyranny the death knight now has the submerge ability. Bones cave terrain is now cave path. Once multi spear is picked up, there are no more prompts if you want to pick it up. Fixed visible fog clearer by dire wolf altar. Fixed an issue with some Swamp Wolves, Great Wolves and Wolf Riders that appeared unable to go to level 3. The area that triggers Lavinia's appearance is slightly larger.
- Clammie now has the leader ellipse and leading animations with halo in Trumpeter, Prime, Direwolf Rider/Master.
- Changed some movement costs and defenses for bosavi and giant rat. They are quicker in caves and forests, less vulnerable in caves and villages, more vulnerable in shallow water, on hills and mountains. Bosavi now have the ability to skirmish, and the rat king has a leading animation with halo.
- Ghast movetype is now "gruefoot."
- Saurian leaders Sklizle, Zslap and Hertrazzir are specifically given female genders.

Version 1.0.8 - 9/6/10
- S16: Fixed bug that brought orcs & saurians into the battle in turn 2 instead of turn 10. Fixed display of new objectives for side 7 after turn 15. Enemy has more gold and less limits on the number of level 2's they may recruit. A village near Shining's keep is now owned by Phillips' team, to keep them from wandering too far south. If you try to kill the Archduke with bats, his bodyguards appear and defend him. Fixed a reference to Hertrazzir as "he."
- S6: Same trick with Cat: if you try to kill her with bats, other units appear and defend her.
- S5: Expanded map, giving Clammie and Kennison many places to hide from the Archduke's guards. Clammie's chance to be hit has been set to zero for a shorter number of rounds (previously a random number less than 10, now a random number less than 6). Giant rats now have a leader and a keep. Added Stern's new swinging trumpeter sprite. After much fuss with Rhyging's animated wall torch, I had to settle for one frame of torch set low to the wall. Full torch animation will be included in 1.9. Added new quintain sprite. Added West's "Desert Chase" music.
- S9: Greta will not speak at Ronry's grave.
- S13: Flipped Harxias portrait so you can see his portrait and sprite at the same time. Fixed another reference to Hertrazzir as "he."
- S14: New limits on the number of contemporaneous Wraiths Zaxtex may recruit: one for Hard games, two for Normal, no limit for Easy. Added Stern's ghast sprite. Made ghast regenerating. In easy games, the healing potion Um Brok drinks will actually work now. Removed three villages. The Multi-Spear Guardian no longer attacks from a chasm, so hopefully he will actually attack more often. Changed caution on side three to 0 for the same reason. Shroud is cleared before battles between Xaztex's spirits and Kleezyx's minions.
- S15: Game now scrolls to Bort on his turn. Reduced the number of villages from 22 to 15. Added Santiago Iborra's goblin portrait.
- S1: Shining recruits Woodsmen once you've killed all his Horsemen. (Originally reported but not included: Increased the size of Clammie's keep.)
- S2,5,12: Turn limits are incrementally expanded as new objectives are given, so the total number of turns you get depends on your progress.
- Campaign descriptions will no longer say Swamplings has 16 scenarios, since two of those scenarios do not have battles.
- Archduke's and Shining's experience points will not get reset to zero at any part of the campaign.
- Began phasing out unnecessary unit WML files. Pillager file is no longer being used, but is still in the units folder, to ensure some backward compatibility for users who update the campaign while they're in the middle of playing it. If all goes well with the Pillager, future updates will phase out other units.
- Removed deprecated begin= and end= keys from all units. Fixed Giant Rat and Bosavi to get better movement and defense in water. Very subtle change to Wolf Rider description.

Version 1.0.7 - 8/14/10
- S5: Fixed bug with Kennison recalling the secret passage too soon.
- S6: Fixed bug with Cat.

Version 1.0.6 - 8/13/10
- S8: fixed bug where Clammie's type is incorrectly restored after riding the wolf.
- S16: fixed bug where Sydd fights on the wrong side. Either Sydd or Yryrcyn are recalled in turn 10, not both.
- S6-16: Greta the Bosavi rat is automatically recalled at the start of each scenario (except Thunderstruck).
- S10: added the tale of the feather.
- S2: added the original "sad.ogg" from Northern Rebirth.
- S5: fixed moveto event to trigger if you walk up behind Kennison. Also, you no longer will get a double portion of rats if Greta dies before you get to the bridge. However, if you skip the village, go to the bridge, trigger the rat event, then turn around and go back and enter the village, you will still get twice as many rats attacking you, and you deserve it.
- New portraits: added Santiago Iborra's swordsman portrait, Lord Bob's TROW Jessica portrait for Cat, and Bera's Margrave portrait for Hertrazzir. Juggled around some other saurian portraits. Added Kaldred's statues to Dire Cave.
- Increased Goblin Wose hitpoints from 43 to 50. Increased Firefly hitpoints from 44 to 50, movement from 9 to 10. Increased Cutthroat hitpoints from 46 to 50, attacks from 3 to 4. Increased Moonbeam attacks from 2 to 3. Increased Nocturne club attacks from 2 to 3 (bolas remains 2). Updated custom amla descriptions so you'll know which ones do not have full healing. Experience is standardized at 100 for "dead end" level two units: Nocturne, Wose, Peltast, Jinx. Mosquito will level to Rabid Buzzblood at 30. Giant Rat will level to Bosavi. Gave Bosavi a regular zone of control.
- Map filenames all end in .map Not exactly the most-demanded of improvements, but there you are.
- Added GPL 2 license, so it really looks as if I know what I'm doing now.

Version 1.0.5 - 8/9/10
- S14: Removed magic talking key events entirely, because of reported crashing in Ubuntu. When white altar glimmers, it no longer rotates accidentally.

Version 1.0.4 - 8/8/10
- S10-11: fixed some problems with Misris' experience. She will start turn 1 in S11 as the same unit she was at the end of S9, and there's a menu to permanently change her to a wolf rider if you want to. There is also a very very minor adjustment to Eeep, to reflect the fact that dim Impalers need more 6 xp to level up than dim wolf riders, so a level two Eeep will get 6 xp extra after switching. Added warning about a problem with changing Eeep or Misris to a wolf rider during another side's turn: if you do this, you won't get to pick your levelup choices. So don't do this.
- All Moonbeam units now require 30 xp to level up. Sorry it was so high before.
- S9: There's also a chance of Eeep getting gypped out of 6 xp here too, so it's automatically awarded to Eeep if he starts this scenario at level 2. Also added a little message from the narrator so his levelup isn't quite so abrupt.
- S6: Changed scatter area for wild things, so they appear a little closer to your keep. Changed their ai to avoid the rogue's keep. Also, if you really want to load the scenario out of the blue, you can do that now and still have Eeep.
- S5: The water in the sewer now has the animated water from Alarantalara's campaign Roar of the Woses. Changed the way the assassin Clammie and the "real" Clammie are stored and switched, so the annoying scroll at the start of each turn is gone. Cut the amount of gold on hard from 200 to 150. Removed event that triggered defeat if you attack Kennison from behind. Some slight map redesign. I may have made this level too easy - but a more thorough redesign is on the way. Changed the scatter macro so rats don't get trapped in deep water or appear inside walls. Fixed a rare problem with place_shroud.
- S2: If you keep killing bats, Ronry tells you to stop doing that.
- S14: Wider trigger to fire Lavinia's first message. Added variable so she doesn't repeat herself. Xaztex's spirits no longer squat on top of the magical key.
- S1: Shining now has -2 income on easy games.
- Passing references to Haldric, Hamel and Knalga have been removed. Haldric and Hamel haven't been born yet, and Knalga is so far away it's unlikely the thundersticks would be called "Knalgan craftsmanship."

Version 1.0.3 - 8/3/10
- S6: fixed bug where Eeep loses all XP. (You'll need to replay from the beginning of "At Death's Door" to get your Eeep XP saved properly)
- S9: fixed bug which would have caused multiple Eeeps to appear on recall list in S12. Also, if Eeep levels up in this scenario, he will start S11 as the same unit he is now. If he was level two in an earlier scenario, he will start this level as your choice of goblin knight or pillager.
- S11-16: if you change Eeep to wolf rider and he is already level 2, he will become your choice of goblin knight or pillager. If you managed to get him to level 3 in S9, he will remain at that level for the rest of the campaign (although direwolf riders will be able to go to level 4 after S14).
- S12: threw out some code that was helpful for testing, but potentially disastrous to recall list consistency.
- S12-16: Augalol's hilarious recall quips will be spoken by Duldursil if Aug's no longer with us.
- S15,16: replaced buggy mainline fog clearer macros.

- S11: scroll to the dwarves at the start of their turns.
- S15: fixed an uncooperative fog clearer next to Erong. Improved the map a bit.
- S17: expanded Reed's story and added a bit about wolf riding. Added JWL's wolf rider art.

- added two more Bera goblin portraits.

- new unit: Vundergobo! The Vundergobo is a level 1 Thundergobo with a slightly lower chance of misfiring and shooting himself.
- new unit: Goblin Jinx. A levelup from the Goblin Mimic, the Jinx is basically as good as a saurian augur, although he'll be a bit dim, weak or slow.
- new units: Goblin Moonbeam, Goblin Nocturne. Mixed fighters with Nightstalk ability. 
- new unit: Goblin Peltast, a level 2 javelineer. Goblin Wose, level 2 heavy infantryman.
